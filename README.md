# Reinforcement Learning Project

This repository contains the code and documentation for the Reinforcement Learning project, conducted as part of `RL - Apprentissage par renforcement - CS - PARIS - SACLAY (2023-2024)` course. The project aims to implement and experiment with various Reinforcement Learning methods on the Highway-env collection of environments.

## Project Overview

The project is divided into three main parts:

- **Part 1: Highway Environment**

  - Implementation of a DQN from scratch to solve the Highway environment.
  - Evaluation of training performance and agent behavior.

- **Part 2: Continuous Actions**

  - Configuration of an environment for continuous actions.
  - Implement an algorithm of choice, possibly using code from lab sessions.
  - Comparison of results with Highway environment using discrete actions.

- **Part 3: Stable Baselines Reference Implementations**
  - Utilization of the StableBaselines library to train PPO and DQN.
  - Experimentation to study various aspects of the task and algorithm, such as generalization on different environments, and hyperparameter tuning using Optuna (the file called optuna_100000.zip is an example of a tuned model.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into three main folders:

- **part1:** Contains code and documentation for Part 1 of the project, focusing on the Highway environment.

- **part2:** Contains code and documentation for Part 2 of the project, exploring continuous action environments.

- **part3:** Contains code and documentation for Part 3 of the project, utilizing Stable Baselines for reference implementations.

## Usage

Each part folder contains the necessary code and documentation to replicate the experiments and results described in the project. Detailed instructions for running and understanding the code are provided within each folder.
